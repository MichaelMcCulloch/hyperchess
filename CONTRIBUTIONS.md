## Issue Reporting

When reporting issues, it is mandatory to clearly state the delta between the current observed behavior and the expected desired behavior. Please describe:

1. **Current Observed Behavior**: What is happening right now? 
2. **Expected Desired Behavior**: What should happen instead?

Provide an example of the current behavior, and an example of the desired behavior if possible.

Issues that do not clearly define this or are otherwise ambiguous are not something I can implement.
